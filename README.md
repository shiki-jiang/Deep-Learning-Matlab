# Deep-Learning-Matlab
Sample codes for deep learning using Matlab

Train a small CNN to classify handwritten digits (0–9) from 28×28 grayscale images. This shows the end-to-end deep-learning workflow in MATLAB: datastore → model → training → evaluation. It runs without pretrained models.
Add-ons:
Required: Deep Learning Toolbox
Optional: Image Processing Toolbox (for extra preprocessing), Parallel Computing Toolbox (GPU & multi-GPU)
